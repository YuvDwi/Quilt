        <h1 data-llm="title">How to Build Modern Web Applications</h1>
        <div data-llm="content">
            Modern web applications require a combination of frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
            along with backend frameworks such as Node.js, Python Flask, or FastAPI. The key is to create 
            responsive, user-friendly interfaces that communicate effectively with robust server-side APIs.

            <div data-llm="content">
                Vector databases store high-dimensional vectors that represent semantic meaning of text, images, 
                or other data types. They enable similarity search and are crucial for AI applications like 
                recommendation systems, semantic search, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems. 
                Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, and Chroma.

            <div data-llm="content">
                Integrating machine learning models into web applications involves several steps: data preprocessing, 
                model training, deployment via APIs, and real-time inference. Tools like TensorFlow Serving, 
                PyTorch Lightning, and Hugging Face Transformers make this process more accessible for developers.

            <div data-llm="content">
                RESTful API design follows principles like statelessness, uniform interface, and proper HTTP methods. 
                Key considerations include versioning, authentication, rate limiting, error handling, and documentation. 
                FastAPI and Express.js are popular frameworks that encourage good API design patterns.

                Database performance can be improved through indexing, query optimization, connection pooling, 
                and caching strategies. For large-scale applications, consider database sharding, read replicas, 
                and choosing the right database type (SQL vs NoSQL) based on your data access patterns.
